CVE-2015-1819 check failed

Nokogiri versions before 1.6.6.4 contain a vulnerable version of libxml2 as a C extension.
The vulnerability allows for memory consumption denial of service. 
Evidence:
	Vulnerable nokogiri gem version found: 1.6.6.2


CVE-2015-5312 check failed

The xmlStringLenDecodeEntities function in parser.c in libxml2 before 2.9.3 does
not properly prevent entity expansion which allows context-dependent attackers
to cause a denial of service CPU consumption via crafted XML data a different vulnerability
than CVE-2014-3660. 
Evidence:
	Vulnerable nokogiri gem version found: 1.6.6.2


CVE-2015-7497 check failed

Heap-based buffer overflow in the xmlDictComputeFastQKey function in dict.c in libxml2
before 2.9.3 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service via unspecified
vectors. 
Evidence:
	Vulnerable nokogiri gem version found: 1.6.6.2


CVE-2015-7498 check failed

Heap-based buffer overflow in the xmlParseXmlDecl function in parser.c in libxml2
before 2.9.3 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service via unspecified
vectors related to extracting errors after an encoding conversion failure. 
Evidence:
	Vulnerable nokogiri gem version found: 1.6.6.2


CVE-2015-7499 check failed

Heap-based buffer overflow in the xmlGROW function in parser.c in libxml2 before 2.9.3
allows context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive process memory information
via unspecified vectors. 
Evidence:
	Vulnerable nokogiri gem version found: 1.6.6.2


CVE-2015-7500 check failed

The xmlParseMisc function in parser.c in libxml2 before 2.9.3 allows context-dependent
attackers to cause a denial of service out-of-bounds heap read via unspecified vectors
related to incorrect entities boundaries and start tags. 
Evidence:
	Vulnerable nokogiri gem version found: 1.6.6.2


CVE-2015-8241 check failed

The xmlNextChar function in libxml2 2.9.2 does not properly check the state which allows
context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service heap-based buffer over-read
and application crash or obtain sensitive information via crafted XML data. 
Evidence:
	Vulnerable nokogiri gem version found: 1.6.6.2


CVE-2015-8242 check failed

The xmlSAX2TextNode function in SAX2.c in the push interface in the HTML parser in libxml2
before 2.9.3 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service stack-based
buffer over-read and application crash or obtain sensitive information via crafted
XML data. 
Evidence:
	Vulnerable nokogiri gem version found: 1.6.6.2


CVE-2015-8317 check failed

The xmlParseXMLDecl function in parser.c in libxml2 before 2.9.3 allows context-dependent
attackers to obtain sensitive information via an 1 unterminated encoding value or
2 incomplete XML declaration in XML data which triggers an out-of-bounds heap read

Evidence:
	Vulnerable nokogiri gem version found: 1.6.6.2


CVE-2016-0753 check failed

There is a possible input validation circumvention vulnerability in Active Model.
Code that uses Active Model based models including Active Record models and does not
validate user input before passing it to the model can be subject to an attack where specially
crafted input will cause the model to skip validations. 
Evidence:
	Vulnerable activemodel gem version found: 4.2.4
